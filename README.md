Panes wraps a native desktop UI around external coding agents, git, terminal workflows, and lightweight file editing. It gives developers one place to chat with agents, inspect diffs, approve actions, manage multi-repo work, and keep an audit trail of what happened.

Panes is not a full IDE, but it does ship with a built-in multi-tab editor for quick review and edits without leaving the app.

## Features

### Chat & Agents

- Streaming chat with structured content blocks for text, thinking, actions, diffs, approvals, attachments, and usage updates
- Codex chat integration via `codex app-server`
- Claude chat integration via a Claude Agent SDK sidecar
- OpenCode chat integration as a native engine, available once the `opencode` CLI is on your `PATH`, including custom and local OpenAI-compatible providers (LM Studio, Ollama, vLLM, and others)
- Plan mode, attachments, reasoning effort controls, per-thread approval/network overrides, and Codex-specific sandbox-mode overrides
- Global FTS message search with keyboard navigation
- Windowed message loading and lazy hydration for long threads/action output

### Git

- Multi-repo awareness with per-repo active toggles and trust levels
- Changes, diff, stage, unstage, discard, commit, and soft reset
- Branch management with pagination and search
- Commit history, stash operations, worktree management, and remote management
- Repo initialization flow from the UI
- Filesystem watching plus cached/truncated file-tree scanning for large repos

### Terminal & Harnesses

- Native PTY terminal powered by xterm.js + WebGL
- Terminal groups, split panes, draggable resize, and broadcast mode
- Session replay/resume and renderer diagnostics
- Harness detection, install, and launch flows for Codex CLI, Claude Code, Gemini CLI, Kiro, OpenCode, Kilo Code, and Factory Droid
- Multi-launch mode that can fan out one session per harness, optionally with one git worktree per session

### Editor & Desktop UX

- Multi-tab CodeMirror editor with dirty tracking, save, and external-modification warnings
- Built-in find/replace (`Cmd+F`, `Cmd+H`) and editor toggle (`Cmd+E`)
- Command palette for commands, files, threads, workspaces, harnesses, and git actions
- Setup wizard for Node.js and Codex requirements, plus Git detection
- Update dialog with download/install flow
- Crash recovery, toast notifications, and session persistence

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

| Requirement | Version |
|---|---|
| Rust toolchain | stable |
| Node.js | 24+ |
| pnpm | 9+ |
| Codex CLI | Required for the Codex chat engine; setup can install it via npm |
| Tauri v2 prerequisites | [See Tauri docs](https://v2.tauri.app/start/prerequisites/) |

### Install on macOS

```bash
brew install --cask wygoralves/tap/panes
```

Homebrew is the primary macOS install path for prebuilt Panes releases. The macOS release is shipped as a universal app, so the same DMG works on both Apple Silicon and Intel Macs. The app updater then handles later versions in-app.

Panes is not currently signed and notarized with Apple, so Homebrew only reduces Gatekeeper friction; it does not eliminate it. The tap applies a best-effort quarantine removal step during install, but macOS may still require a manual first-launch confirmation depending on system policy. If that happens, use Finder's Open flow or download the DMG directly from [GitHub Releases](https://github.com/wygoralves/panes/releases/latest).

If Gatekeeper blocks a direct DMG install, use these commands instead of disabling Gatekeeper globally:

```bash
# If macOS blocks the downloaded DMG itself
xattr -d com.apple.quarantine ~/Downloads/Panes*.dmg
open ~/Downloads/Panes*.dmg

# After dragging Panes.app into /Applications, if first launch is blocked
xattr -dr com.apple.quarantine /Applications/Panes.app
open /Applications/Panes.app
```

Maintainers can find the tap/release automation setup in [docs/homebrew-distribution.md](./docs/homebrew-distribution.md).

### Install on Windows

Download the latest `*-setup.exe` installer from [GitHub Releases](https://github.com/wygoralves/panes/releases/latest) and run it. Later updates are delivered in-app through the Tauri updater.

For this Windows release, the validated scope is installer, updater, startup, and bundled-runtime compatibility. It does not guarantee that Codex and Claude are fully validated end to end through the in-app chat flow yet, so expect some rough edges there.

### Install on Linux

Download the latest `.AppImage` or `.deb` from [GitHub Releases](https://github.com/wygoralves/panes/releases/latest).

For AppImage:

```bash
chmod +x Panes*.AppImage
./Panes*.AppImage
```

For Debian-family systems:

```bash
sudo apt install ./Panes*_amd64.deb
```

Both direct-download Linux install paths receive later versions through the in-app updater. AppImage updates replace the app bundle directly. `.deb` updates reinstall the signed Debian package and may request administrator privileges during install.

Panes does not currently publish an APT repository, so the supported Debian-family install path is the direct `.deb` download above.

### Install and Run from Source

```bash
git clone https://github.com/wygoralves/panes.git
cd panes
pnpm install
pnpm tauri:dev
```

### Codex Terminal Notifications

Panes can surface Codex terminal notifications after a one-time install from `Agent notifications` in the app settings. That writes a `notify = [...]` command into your Codex user config that points back to Panes.

Codex currently passes a single JSON payload to the configured `notify` program. `panes codex-notify` handles the current `agent-turn-complete` payload, extracts the last assistant message, and routes it back to the owning Panes terminal session so Panes can show both desktop and in-app terminal notifications.

This only works inside terminals launched by Panes, because the installed command relies on `PANES_NOTIFY_ADDR`, `PANES_NOTIFY_TOKEN`, `PANES_WORKSPACE_ID`, and `PANES_SESSION_ID`.

### Claude Terminal Notifications

Panes can surface Claude terminal notifications after a one-time install from `Agent notifications` in the app settings. That merges Panes-managed hook commands into your Claude user settings without removing existing hooks.

That hook bridge currently handles Claude `Notification`, `Stop`, `StopFailure`, `SessionStart`, and `SessionEnd` events, routing them back to the owning Panes terminal session so Panes can show desktop and in-app notifications and clear stale state when a Claude session starts or ends.

This only works inside terminals launched by Panes, because the installed hook command depends on the Panes terminal session environment.

### Generic OSC Terminal Notifications

Panes also listens for common desktop-notification OSC sequences emitted directly by programs running inside a Panes terminal session. These work without any Claude or Codex setup. The backend currently recognizes `OSC 9`, `OSC 777;notify;...`, and `OSC 99` notification payloads before terminal replay is recorded, so live notifications do not fire again when a terminal session is resumed.

`OSC 9;4` progress reports are intentionally left alone and are not treated as notifications.

### Using Local Models (LM Studio, Ollama, and Other OpenAI-Compatible Servers)

Panes does not host or proxy models itself. Local model support comes from the chat engines it integrates, and there are two working paths today.

**OpenCode engine**

OpenCode accepts any OpenAI-compatible endpoint as a custom provider. Add a `provider` block to `opencode.json` (project-level) or `~/.config/opencode/opencode.json` (global). For LM Studio:

```json
{
  "$schema": "https://opencode.ai/config.json",
  "provider": {
    "lmstudio": {
      "npm": "@ai-sdk/openai-compatible",
      "name": "LM Studio (local)",
      "options": {
        "baseURL": "http://127.0.0.1:1234/v1"
      },
      "models": {
        "qwen2.5-coder-7b-instruct": {
          "name": "Qwen 2.5 Coder 7B"
        }
      }
    }
  }
}
```

Replace the model id with whichever model is loaded in LM Studio, then start LM Studio's local server. With the `opencode` CLI installed, select the OpenCode engine in Panes' model picker: the provider shows up in the engine's provider list, with your configured models grouped underneath it. The same pattern works for Ollama, vLLM, or any other server that speaks the OpenAI-compatible API, just point `baseURL` at that server instead.

**Codex engine**

Recent Codex CLI releases ship `ollama` and `lmstudio` as reserved, built-in `model_providers` ids. Point Codex at one of them in `~/.codex/config.toml`:

```toml
model_provider = "lmstudio"
model = "qwen2.5-coder-7b-instruct"
```

or define a custom endpoint yourself:

```toml
[model_providers.local_ollama]
name = "Ollama (local)"
base_url = "http://localhost:11434/v1"
wire_api = "responses"
```

Panes' Codex engine reads whatever `codex app-server` reports from `model/list`, so once Codex CLI is configured this way, the resulting model appears in Panes' Codex model picker with no Panes-side setup. This depends on the installed Codex CLI version supporting `model_providers`; update Codex if a provider id is rejected.

### Production Build

```bash
pnpm tauri:build
```

Common bundle artifacts include macOS DMGs/app archives, Linux DEB/AppImage outputs, and Windows NSIS installers, depending on platform and target.

### Release signing

GitHub Actions signs updater artifacts automatically with the repository Actions secrets `TAURI_SIGNING_PRIVATE_KEY` and `TAURI_SIGNING_PRIVATE_KEY_PASSWORD`; neither is tracked in Git or exported in a developer shell. The local recovery material is `.tauri-signing/panes-updater.key`, its `.pub` file, and `.tauri-signing/panes-updater.key.password`. They are ignored by Git; do not commit, share, or sync them to an untrusted service. The password file is intentional: Tauri updater private keys require a password, so it lets the repository restore signing without requiring anyone to memorize that password. The `.pub` file is already the Base64 value expected by Tauri's `pubkey` setting; never encode it a second time. The client public key and update URL are maintained in `src-tauri/tauri.conf.json`. Keep the signing material unchanged after release: replacing it requires a manual reinstall for users on an older public key.

To configure or restore both GitHub Actions secrets from that local recovery copy, run `./scripts/configure-tauri-updater-signing.ps1`. Use `-CheckOnly` to verify the local key, password, and embedded public key without changing GitHub. To rotate the key intentionally, run `./scripts/configure-tauri-updater-signing.ps1 -Rotate`; it archives the previous local recovery material, generates a new key/password pair, updates the embedded public key, and configures both GitHub secrets.

### Release workflow

Business and functional acceptance happens locally before committing. A push to `master` uses GitHub Actions as the cross-platform build and publishing service: it creates the signed desktop release artifacts and the updater manifest once. GitHub Actions does not replace local business testing or launch the application as a release-acceptance test. The optional compatibility and unsigned Windows installer checks run only when manually started with **Run workflow** in GitHub Actions.

Git is recommended for the repo-management features, but the app can still launch without it.

## Development

```bash
pnpm tauri:dev          # full desktop app in dev mode
pnpm tauri:build        # native desktop bundles

pnpm dev                # frontend-only dev server
pnpm build              # frontend production build
pnpm test               # Vitest suite
pnpm typecheck          # TypeScript no-emit check

pnpm build:claude-sidecar   # bundle the runtime Claude sidecar
pnpm build:desktop          # build frontend + bundled sidecar assets, not native app bundles
pnpm prune:artifacts:check  # inspect generated artifacts that are safe to remove
pnpm prune:artifacts        # remove repo-local generated artifacts like src-tauri/target
pnpm prune:artifacts:stale:check  # inspect stale Rust/Tauri artifacts older than 7 days
pnpm prune:artifacts:stale        # remove stale Rust/Tauri artifacts older than 7 days
pnpm release:check          # evaluate whether a release should be cut
pnpm release                # run release-it
```

Rust-only:

```bash
cd src-tauri
cargo check
cargo fmt
cargo clippy
```

Generated build artifacts can grow quickly during Tauri/Rust development. `pnpm prune:artifacts` removes all repo-local generated output, while `pnpm prune:artifacts:stale` trims only Rust/Tauri artifacts older than 7 days. Both are safe to regenerate on the next build, and the stale mode also accepts `--older-than-days=<n>` if you want a different window.

### Runtime Paths

| Path | Purpose |
|---|---|
| macOS / Linux: `~/.agent-workspace/config.toml` | App configuration |
| macOS / Linux: `~/.agent-workspace/workspaces.db` | SQLite database |
| macOS / Linux: `~/.agent-workspace/logs` | App log directory |
| Windows: `%LOCALAPPDATA%\Panes\config.toml` | App configuration |
| Windows: `%LOCALAPPDATA%\Panes\workspaces.db` | SQLite database |
| Windows: `%LOCALAPPDATA%\Panes\logs` | App log directory |

### Localization

User-facing frontend copy is localized with `i18next`/`react-i18next`. Treat i18n as part of the implementation of every new feature, not as cleanup work after the UI is already built.

- Do not ship new visible UI strings hardcoded in components, dialogs, menus, toasts, or empty states
- Add or update translation keys in both `src/i18n/resources/en/` and `src/i18n/resources/pt-BR/`
- Reuse the existing namespace structure whenever possible and keep keys aligned across locales
- Keep the i18n resource test passing when copy changes

## Architecture

Panes uses a React + Zustand frontend running inside a Tauri shell, with a Rust backend that owns persistence, engine orchestration, git operations, terminal management, and filesystem-safe file access.

The app currently exposes Codex, Claude, and OpenCode as chat engines. Codex talks to `codex app-server`; Claude is bridged through the bundled Claude runtime sidecar; OpenCode talks to a locally installed `opencode` CLI and becomes selectable in the engine and model picker once that CLI is detected on your `PATH`.
